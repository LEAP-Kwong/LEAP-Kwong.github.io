# Research Themes

## 1) Youth Mental Health

We are interested in examining the causes and consequences of youth mental health, combining biological, psychological and social data alongside longitudinal data to identify critical periods of youth mental health.

## 2) Life course Mental Health

We are interested in examining how mental health changes across the life course and if there are specific determinants underlying mental health at key stages of development.

## 3) Methods Development

We are keen to develop methods that facilitate access, analysis and interpretation of longitudinal data. To that end, we have developed [TIDAL](https://tidal-modelling.github.io/), a free and easy to use tool that facilitates trajectory modelling. 

## 4) Integrating Genetics and Longitudinal Data

We are interested in integrating genetic data into longitudinal models to examine when genetic effects may having their greatest effect of developmental traits.
