# Poppy Grimes

I am a PhD student on the MRC funded Precision Medicine programme in the Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences. I have a BSc in Biology and MSc in Neuroscience, both from the University of Sussex. 
 
My research focuses on the psychiatric and genetic epidemiology of adolescent depression. I am interested in the heterogeneity of depression symptoms and their genetic underpinnings across this critical period of as well as methods used to study this. Some of the methods I use include longitudinal trajectory modelling, network analysis, polygenic risk scores, genome-wide association, and genomic structural equation modelling.
 
Outside of work, I spend my time trying to not think about work and like wearing hats and running half marathons for fun.
