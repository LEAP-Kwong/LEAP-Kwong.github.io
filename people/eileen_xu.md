# Eileen Xu

I am a PhD student in the Division of Psychiatry at the University of Edinburgh. I am interested in how risk and protective factors in a young person's environment can influence their mental health over time. As well as my current PhD work, I am also passionate about intersectionality in research, neurodiversity and science communication. 

Outside of work, I can usually be found working on some type of knitting/crochet project, or out on a long walk with my dog Rosa.
