# Sally Marshall

I will join the LEAP group in Autumn 2024 as an MRC Transition Fellowship Postdoc.

My main research interest is the heterogeneity of depression and its underlying aetiology.

While completing my PhD, as part of the MRC Precision Medicine Doctoral Training Program, I began to investigate subgroups of depression defined using weight and sleep symptoms.

As a member of the LEAP group, I will continue this research by examining the relationship between weight-sleep subgroups of depression and antidepressant response and working with collaborators to study the genetics of weight-sleep subgroups in different cohorts.

In my spare time I like to bake, knit and explore new places.
