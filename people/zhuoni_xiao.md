# Zhuoni Xiao

I am a Research Fellow at the Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences.

I completed my PhD in Developmental Psychology at the University of Edinburgh in 2023 and joined Generation Scotland as a Research Fellow shortly. 

I am interested in investigating the impact of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) on lifespan mental health using various research approaches such as cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, Ecological Momentary Assessment and qualitative interviews. I am also interested in co-production work with lived experiences. 

Outside of work, I am very interested in sports such as badminton, squash, and volleyball.
