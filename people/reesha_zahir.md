# Reesha Zahir

I am a PhD student on the Wellcome Trust Translational neuroscience programme at the University of Edinburgh. My research focuses on the intersection between sleep and mental ill health in autistic children and adolescents. 

I used a mixed-methods approach for my research which involved 1. Longitudinal trajectory modelling in a large-scale secondary dataset, and 2. Collecting primary sleep and mental health data from a cohort of autistic adolescents. I co-produced my research with a team of autistic people with lived experience of sleep problems.

Outside of work, I like to lift really heavy objects at the gym, and I also love listening to music (and I often do both at the same time).
